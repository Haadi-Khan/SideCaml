# Instructions
As of MS2, the only requirements needed to install and build our system are to ensure the proper libraries are installed. In particular, the following libraries must be installed: [Cohttp], [Lwt], [Yojson]

To do so, run the following commands:

`opam install Cohttp`
`opam install Lwt`
`opam install Yojson`
