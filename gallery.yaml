  Our project is implementing a transformer architecture-based neural network 
  trained on high-performing (i.e., highly-upvoted) posts on the popular 
  social media app "Sidechat". The posts will be gathered specifically from 
  Sidechat's Cornell community, which will ideally encourage our model to 
  output Cornell-centric posts.

  As a test of the model's abilities, our group will make a series of posts 
  to the app using text solely generated from our model, in the hope that
  the model can mimick a "Cornellian" and thus garner a positive following.
