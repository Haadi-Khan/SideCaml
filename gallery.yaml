  Our project is to implement a transformer architecture-based neural network 
  trained on high-performing (i.e. highly-upvoted) posts on the popular social 
  media app "Sidechat." The posts will be gathered specifically from Sidechat's 
  Cornell community, which will encourage our model to output Cornell-centric 
  posts. As a test of the model's abilities, our group will make a series of 
  posts to the app using text solely generated from our model, in the hope that
  the model can mimic an entertaining, human Cornell student and thus garner a
  positive following.
